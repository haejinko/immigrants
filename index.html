						<h2>Immigrants</h2>
						<p>Immigrants + foreigners need more support and help in obtaining the visa, maintaining their visa status, and living in the foreign country because there are so many opportunities that are taken away from this norm and most are unaware of their benefits and what they lack in.</p><br>
                        <h2>State of the Art</h2>
                        <p><b>-</b><font size="3"> A man named William Han tried for his citizenship for the past 15 years and is now on the verge of being deported back to his country. Attending Columbia University, he also got into his law school, and changed his student visa into a work visa. However it turns out that it'd lead to "the imminent cancellation" of his work visa and his current visa is on the verge of expiring in July. According to statistics, it states that "233,000 highly skilled applicatns filed for work visas, but by law the government could only allow 85,000 of them to have visas, 20,000 of those being reserved for applicatns with advanced degrees" (Han).</font><br>

<font size="2">References: Han, William. "I spent the last 15 years trying to become an American. I've failed." <i>VOX</i>, 23 Jun. 2015, https://www.vox.com/2015/6/23/8823349/immigration-system-broken. Accessed 24 Mar. 2019.</font> </p>
                        
                        <p><b>-</b><font size="3"> Not only America but in Korea and other parts of the world, Immigration has been a key conflict to the society today. A family from the Philippines was interviewed recently talking about how their family was separated due to visa status. The mom's name was Norely B. Calicdan; she had three children and a mom living in Korea with her. However, due to visa expiration, her son and mother had to reapply for visa. Throughout the process, language was an issue, they had to reach a certain level in the foreigner program they were enrolled into, and the process was also dependent on luck. After the long process, her mother was deported back to the Phillipines and her son was able to come back to Korea after about half a year.</font><br>

                        <p><b>-</b><font size="3"> Jin K. Park, a senior at Harvard University, recently became the first Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) beneficiary to win the Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford. During the Obama administration, DACA recipients were allowed to travel overseas under special circumstances, including academic study. Under the current Trump administration however, the status of DACA is in turmoil and recipients are currently not granted re-entry into the US if they go abroad. Park must now either give up this one-in-a-million opportunity or risk giving up the life he led up to this point in the US. Park has stated "I know where I belong. If I have to spend the rest of my life trying to convince this counry to let me back in then that's what I'm going to do" (Guo & Su).</font>

						<h2>Further Interviews + Cases</h2>
						<p><font size="2">Author: Hae Jin Ko</font><br><font size="3">This was an incident that happened recently. My parents moved to Korea my freshman year of college which was 3 years ago, however they gave up on their permanent residency last August. They are now trying to apply for visa because graduation is next month, but they recently found out how hard this process is. Apparently, they have to wait a certain period of time to register for this visa (more strict if you recently gave up on green card), and even after applying, the visa might not come out. It is a different story when you have a good job to get sponsorship from the business, but my parents have a low income and just church planted in Korea. Therefore, they cannot make it to my graduation, and they are unsure when they would be able to get their visa to visit the states. Even when they do get their visa, they would have to renew it every two years. The fastest way as of now, would be if I apply for citizenship and register my parents to receive their greencard again so that the process of visiting would be easier.</font></p>
